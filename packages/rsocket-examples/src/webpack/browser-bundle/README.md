# Webpack Browser Bundle Example

This folder provides and example of using Webpack to create a "library" which can be loaded in an HTML file or used in a
browser context without NPM or other bundling tools.

## Files

__rsocket.js__

[rsocket.js](./rsocket.js) demonstrates how to write a "library" that exposes functionality for creating an RSocket
connection using the WebSocket transport. Aditionally this "library" exposes a function for creating a buffer from a
given value.

For your own use cases you will likely need to alter the implementation to expose the functionality you need.

__webpack.config.js__

[webpack.config.js](./webpack.config.js) demonstrates how to configure webpack to create a library file which exposes the exports
from the [./rsocket.js](./rsocket.js) in the global scope of any HTML file which loads the built library file.

__index.html__

[index.html](./index.html) demonstrates how to use the global `rsocket` variable which is exposed by the `rsocket.js` library built by Webpack.

Note: `index.html` does not show how to load the built `rsocket.js` file as that will be up to you/your implementation to decide.

Note: when running the `serve` npm script webpack will automatically host the `index.html` file and inject the `rsocket.js` script into the `<head/>` block.

## Run the server

**Open a terminal:**

Open a terminal in the `simple/server` directory one level up from this README.

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Run the server:**

```bash
npm run start
```

## Run the client

**Open a terminal in this folder and install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

**Run the NPM server script:**

```
npm run serve
```

The above script will run the webpack dev server, which will first compile the "app" and then host the index.html.

**Open in browser:**

Visit [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
